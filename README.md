# EnWord [RU/EN]

## Description

**EnWord** is a project written using TypeScript, React, Vite. That's necessary to learn English.

### What WordsTest application does?

In a nutshell this is a wrapper for database where I store learned english words. Also another users might add new words or test themself: do they remember the translation, and sure user can find saved word.

### Why I used the technologies I used?

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) has typing, and this accelerates development and debugging. So my pick is TS.
2. [React](https://react.dev/) is the library for web and native user interfaces. This is fast, easy and popular.
3. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) speeds up the work of the application.
